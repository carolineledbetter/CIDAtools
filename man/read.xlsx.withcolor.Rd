sheet in a list if mutliple sheets are requested. Creates a colour column for
each colour column specified.
}
\details{
For \code{colourColumns} pass a list of numeric vectors for each
sheet. For example for 2 sheets \code{colourColumns = list(c(1,2), c(3))} for
columns 1 and 2 in the first sheet and 3 in the second. If the list of
\code{colourColumns}
is shorter than the sheets the remaining sheets will be assumed to have no
colour columns. If the list of colour columns is longer only the first n
elements will be used where n is the number of sheets with a warning.
